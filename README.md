# mp3organize
A Perl/Tk script to organize and rename MP3 files by their tags.

Running this script opens a Tk GUI that allows you to choose how your files will be renamed, and
how the folder structure will be organized. This is all done by reading the ID3v1 or ID3v2 tags
in in the mp3 files. If they have no tags, they are sorted into a separate folder.

Libraries Required:
Tk
MP3
